{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "The sky appears blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's how it works:\n\n### 🌤️ What causes the sky to be blue?\n1.  **Sunlight and the Atmosphere**:  \n   Sunlight, which looks white when emitted from the sun, is made up of many colors (like a rainbow). When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air.\n\n2.  **Scattering of Light**:  \n   Different wavelengths of light are scattered by these tiny particles in different amounts. Shorter wavelengths (blue, violet) scatter more than longer wavelengths (red, orange).\n\n3.  **Why Blue?**:\n   - The blue color scatters strongly and is spread across the sky.\n   - Our eyes are also slightly more sensitive to blue light compared to violet.\n\n### 🌈 What's in Sunlight?\nSunlight contains all visible colors:  \n- Violet (shortest wavelength)  \n- Indigo  \n- Blue  \n- Green  \n- Yellow  \n- Orange  \n- Red (longest wavelength)\n\nThese combine to form white sunlight. But when they pass through the atmosphere, they become separated.\n\n### ✨ How Scattering Works\nLight travels in waves. When it hits small particles or gas molecules, some parts of it are redirected—this is scattering.\n- **Rayleigh Scattering**:  \n   Named after Lord Rayleigh (a scientist), this type of scattering happens when light interacts with very small objects much smaller than its wavelength, like nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the air. Blue wavelengths scatter more because they're shorter.\n\n### 🌦️ Why Not Purple?\nEven though violet has an even shorter wavelength than blue, the sky doesn't appear purple or violet because:\n- **Intensity**: The scattering of blue light is stronger.\n- **Human Perception**: Our eyes are less sensitive to violet and other high-frequency colors. Also, the sun emits slightly more yellowish light.\n\n### 🌞 Other Colors in Nature\nLighter colors (like white) reflect more light than darker ones. This explains why clouds look white—they scatter all wavelengths equally. Water absorbs red light but reflects blue—hence lakes appearing blue!\n\nLet me know if you'd like to learn about other fun color phenomena! 😊"}
